## Crystals
<br>
KoalaKraftCrystals (KKC), creates custom crystals which give players certain effects based on the biome they're in.
These crystals are represented by player heads in game. Any player who was a crystal anywhere in their inventory will recieve the appropriate
effect depending on what biome they're in.

#### The crystal effects are as follows - 
<ul>
  <li>Topaz (Yellow) - Grants Saturation 3 & Regeneration 2 in the dessert.</li>
  <li>Sapphire (Blue) - Grants Dolphins Grace & Water Breathing in any ocean biome.</li>
  <li>Onyx (Black) - Grants Slow Falling & Invisibility in the end.</li>
  <li>Emerald (Green) - Grants Haste 2 & Jump Boost 2 in the jungle.</li>
  <li>Ruby (Red) - Grants Fire Resistance & Resistance 2 in the nether.</li>
</ul>

#### All crystals also grant Strength 2.
